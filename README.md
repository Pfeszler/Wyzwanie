This is the website, which i code due to challenge which we get douring html/css course which i participated. The Course instructor gave us a graphics showing how website should look, icons and images which we should use, and our task was create website, which was as close to pattern as it is possible. It was very interesting challange to participata, because i have to use graphic tools to mesure distance between certain element, to get a color from certain elements etc. Website itself is a simple one-page website, designed both for mobile and desktop. It has an interactive button, which shows menu in mobile version.
